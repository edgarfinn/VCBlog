  'Bonobo''s remix of Andromeda by the Gorillaz',
  'Bonobo and Gorillaz are two names we''ve seen a lot of in the last few months.

  The former returned this year with sixth album ''Migration'', including tracks such as the woozy, glitter-sprayed ''No Reason'' with Nick Murphy. After four years away, it was only right for us to put him on the cover of Mixmag and have him play Mixmag Live to celebrate.

  Gorillaz hype has been rife, too, with the animated primates promising a new album at the tail-end of 2016 and officially announcing it - and collaborators such as Kelela, Danny Brown and Grace Jones - in March. Damon Albarn and co. ensured the excitement was still sky high with a spectacle at Printworks London recently.

  Shortly after revealing another 40-odd tunes are ready to be unleashed, Bonobo''s remix of ''Andromeda'' has surfaced online. The Ninja Tune man delivers yet another smooth and gentle treat, guaranteed to put you into a dreamlike state. Listen below.

  'The Cover Mix: Bonobo',
  'bonobo1_170207_150623_1.jpg',
  'Gracing the cover of our February 2017 issue is spellbinding Ninja Tune artist Simon Green aka Bonobo, who since the turn of the millennium has stealthily risen up the ranks to take position as the biggest live and album act in dance music.

  As a DJ he takes dancers on musical trips, combining bold percussive foundations with soaring melodies to lift dance floors into higher realms of euphoria. Bonobo''s cover mix is a prime example of this energising approach, stylishly moving through cuts from Theo Parrish, Axel Boman, Denis Sulta and more. Listen to it and read Greenâ€™s explanation of the tracklist below.',
